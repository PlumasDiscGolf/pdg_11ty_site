This is the second year that the Trilogy Challenge will be at Pioneer Park Disc Golf Course. We had so much fun last year.

Pioneer Park DGC is an 18-hole course using 9 baskets. The back nine is played to the same baskets as the front nine, in the same order (with the exception of 17&18, 17 plays to 9's basket, and 18 plays to 8's basket), using alternate tees.

Players will be using only 3 discs - Gold Saint from Latitude 64°, VIP Ice Tursas from Westside Discs, and Prime Burst Agent from Dynamic Discs. All three discs are included in the player’s pack as well as a towel and mini.

NEW THIS YEAR

We added protected divisions! In addition to the GENERAL division, we have a female-only division, a juniors (18 and under) division, and a juniors female (18 and under) division.

Also new this year is the ability to buy the player's pack without requiring participation in the event itself. If you want the player's pack, but cannot make it to the course that day to play, choose the "NA - Player's Pack Only" division at sign-up. If you are unable to arrange local pickup with us, you can choose to have your player's pack shipped to you for an additional $10. The shipping option will present itself upon selecting the "NA division"
