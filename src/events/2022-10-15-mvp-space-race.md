The MVP Circuit Events Space Race is here!  This unique event will be played as a glow round, starting at 6:30pm (check-in begins at 6pm). Space Race is designed to be a fast-paced, no holds barred, race to the chains! This event uses shorter tees to increase the chances of those glorious aces.

Pioneer Park DGC is an 18-hole course using 9 baskets. The back nine is played to the same baskets as the front nine, in the same order (with the exception of 17&18, 17 plays to 9's basket, and 18 plays to 8's basket), using alternate tees.

The Space Race, however, will use shorter, temporary teeing areas for all 18 holes. Players will ONLY get two (2) throws per hole, both of them from the teeing area. There is no putting in this event, the normal rule for finishing a hole does not apply here.

Players will score points using the following rules:
Ace: 5 points
Chains hit: 3 points
Other metal hit: 1 point

Best score at the end of the round wins!
