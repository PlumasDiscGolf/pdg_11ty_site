We are getting our Random Draw Doubles Saturday events going again!  This week, we are playing The Farm.  The Farm is one of the three (3) tone pole courses out off of Chandler Road that members have built and maintain.  The way it works is each player will put in their $5, then an optional $1 into the ace pot, then partners are randomly chosen.  Our randomizer is either flipping discs or drawing matching minis out of a bag.  If there are an odd number of players, they will play using the “cali” rules.  Cali rules are as follows:  the cali player plays alone, and has the ability to re-throw (1 re-throw on par 3's, two on par 4's, and 3 on par 5's),  only one re-throw per lie up to the maximum allowed on the hole, and re-throws cannot be banked for a later hole.  The winning team splits the pot, if there is a tie at the end of 18 holes, the tied teams can decide which tie-breaker to use. 

These random draw doubles are super fun and casual, come on out to play along!
